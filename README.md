# HR-Analytics-Dashboard
Overview

This dashboard is analysis of a organisation's HR data.

A HR Manager doesn't have much visibility and doesn't know how to analyse their Organisation's employees data. He would like a dashboard of this where he selects a age group, education, gender or job role and can tell attrition rate, attrition by gender, active employees, attrition count of their employees.

He has given us .xlsx files from which we have to create a Dashboard for his quick review so that he could take further decisions for the benefit of the organization.

Thus, we created below interactive dashboard as per his requirement. Now, he could switch and view different employee stats for different departments.

You can view the HR Analytics Dashboard on my Tableau Public Profile link - https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/maanvitha.kanakamedala
